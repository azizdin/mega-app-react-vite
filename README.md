# Multi-Project Repository

This repository is a mono repo that contains multiple projects, each residing in separate folders. Each project uses different frameworks/technologies, and I have organized them as follows:

1. **nextjs**:
   - Description: This project folder contains multiple simple Next.js applications.
   - Technology: Next.js
   - Language: TypeScript

2. **nuxt**:
   - Description: This project folder contains multiple simple Nuxt.js applications.
   - Technology: Nuxt.js
   - Language: JavaScript

3. **react-vite**:
   - Description: This project folder contains multiple simple React applications built with Vite.
   - Technology: React with Vite
   - Language: TypeScript

## Purpose

The purpose of this mono repo is to showcase and manage multiple projects with different frameworks and technologies in one place. By organizing the projects within a single repository, it allows for better code sharing, version control, and maintenance.

### Running Projects

Each project in the repo is independent and can be run separately. Navigate to the respective project folder and follow the instructions to run each individual application.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

I have set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The workflow ensures that each project's code is tested and built automatically on each push to the main branch. If the tests pass successfully, the code is automatically deployed to a predefined hosting environment.
