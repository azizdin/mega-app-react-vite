# React-mega-app

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Mega App repository, a multi-project collection of simple React applications built with Vite. These projects showcase various functionalities and use cases, all implemented with React and enhanced by the speed of Vite and the styling capabilities of Tailwind CSS. The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, ensuring a robust and type-safe development experience.

### Running Projects

- clone the project
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

I have set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The workflow ensures code is tested and built automatically on each push to the main branch. If the tests pass successfully, the code is automatically deployed to a predefined hosting environment.
